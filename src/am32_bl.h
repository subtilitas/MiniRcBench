/**
 * @file am32_bl.h
 * @brief AM32 / BLHeli-style bootloader transport over the ESC signal wire.
 *
 * The ESC signal pin is a single-wire half-duplex serial link at 19200 baud,
 * 8N1.
 *
 * @note A host using a hardware UART on this wire receives its own
 *       transmission and must discard the echo. This implementation bit-bangs
 *       and never samples the pin while driving it, so no echo is captured and
 *       none is discarded. Replies are indexed from the *end* of what arrives,
 *       which is correct either way.
 *
 * Protocol constants are those of a known-working AM32 configurator: the 21-byte
 * init string, the command encodings, and a CRC-16/ARC (polynomial 0xA001,
 * init 0) appended low byte first to every frame.
 *
 * @note Deliberately generic. Firmware flashing needs no new transport — it is
 *       the same setAddress / setBuffer / write sequence aimed at a different
 *       flash range, plus an erase.
 *
 * @warning This drives the same pin as the DShot output. escTaskSuspend() must
 *          be in effect before any call here, or the two will fight over the
 *          pin and the PIO state machines.
