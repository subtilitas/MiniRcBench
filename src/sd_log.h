/**
 * @file sd_log.h
 * @brief Blackbox logging to the microSD slot.
 *
 * Ties together @ref BlackboxEncoder (which turns telemetry into bytes),
 * @ref LogRing (which absorbs card stalls) and FatFs (which does the writing).
 *
 * @section sdlog_cores Which core
 *
 * Core0, always. Core1's only job is DShot frame timing, and an SD card that
 * pauses 30 ms for an internal erase would destroy it. Core0 already tolerates
 * multi-millisecond display DMA bursts and the UI is not real-time critical.
 *
 * The encoder therefore runs on core0 too, reading telemetry through
 * escSnapshot() like the UI does.
 *
 * @section sdlog_loss What happens when the card cannot keep up
 *
 * Bytes are dropped and counted; nothing ever blocks waiting for the card. A
 * gap in the log is recoverable, a stalled UI with a live motor is not. Drops
 * are surfaced rather than swallowed — a silently lossy log is worse than an
 * obviously lossy one, because it looks like data.
 *
 * @see docs/design/blackbox-logging.md
