 * @brief Write to the serial port, dropping rather than blocking.
 *
 * The blocking question is the whole design of this function, and the answer is
 * forced by what else runs on this core. printf() is called from the AM32
 * transport and the SD driver's tracing, both on core0, and core0 must call
 * escHeartbeat() every UI frame or core1 decides the display has hung and zeroes
 * the throttle. A printf that waited for a host that is not reading -- a serial
 * port opened and then left, which is the normal state of a bench board -- would
 * stall core0 past that timeout.
 *
 * So a full buffer drops. Debug output is not worth a motor stopping, and it is
 * certainly not worth a stall that looks like a firmware hang.
