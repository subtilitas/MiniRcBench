/**
 * @file am32_eeprom.h
 * @brief AM32 ESC settings block: layout, decoding and presentation.
 *
 * The byte layout matches the AM32 configurator's `EepromLayout`. Offsets are
 * absolute within the settings region, which starts at the address
 * am32BlEepromAddr() reports for the connected ESC's MCU family.
 *
 * Region map:
 *
 * | Range      | Size | Contents                          |
 * |------------|------|-----------------------------------|
 * | 0x00..0x04 | 5    | boot byte, layout and FW revisions |
 * | 0x05..0x10 | 12   | device name (layout revision < 3)  |
 * | 0x05..0x0C | 8    | extra settings (layout revision 3+)|
 * | 0x11..0x2F | 31   | the settings proper                |
 * | 0x30..0xAF | 128  | startup melody                     |
 * | 0xB0..0xBF | 16   | CAN settings                       |
 *
 * Bytes 0x05..0x0C are overloaded: in layout revision 3 and later they hold
 * ramp/current-PID settings, and before that they are part of the device name
 * string. Fields carry a version gate so the wrong set is never shown.

 * - anything else is not a value AM32 wrote. It substitutes its own default;
 *   this returns -1 so the screen can say so rather than inventing an angle.
 *
 * Treating the field as the old encoding alone is what made a modern ESC read
 * back nonsense until the first `-` or `+` press, which clamped the byte into
 * 0..4 and made the number plausible again. A display that becomes correct
 * *because you edited it* is worse than one that is obviously wrong, because
