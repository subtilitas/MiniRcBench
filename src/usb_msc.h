/**
 * @file usb_msc.h
 * @brief Serving the microSD card to a host as a read-only USB drive.
 *
 * The board is already a USB device — it appears as a serial port. This adds a
 * second interface to the same device, a mass storage one, so that a host can
 * copy logs off the card without anybody finding the microSD adapter that lives
 * in a drawer. @see usb_dev.h for the descriptors that make one device out of
 * two interfaces.
 *
 * @section msc_exclusive Why this is a handover and not a mode
 *
 * A FAT filesystem has no arbitration. Two writers with independent caches will
 * corrupt it, and "two writers" here means the firmware's FatFs and the host's
 * filesystem driver, neither of which can see the other. So the card is never
 * shared: it is *handed over*. The logger flushes, closes and unmounts, and only
 * then does the medium appear to the host. Nothing in sd_log.cpp may touch the
 * card again until the host has let go.
 *
 * That is what @ref MscState is: not a display mode but who owns the card.
 *
 * @section msc_readonly Why read-only
 *
 * The use case is getting `.BFL` files onto a laptop, and read-only buys three
 * things for the cost of nothing anyone wanted: a host filesystem driver cannot
 * corrupt the card, the log numbering cannot be disturbed under the firmware's
 * feet, and there is no need to re-scan on eject to discover what changed. The
 * refusal is reported properly, as a write-protect sense code, so hosts say
 * "disk is write protected" rather than failing in some inventive way.
 *
 * @section msc_medium How "no card in the reader" is expressed
 *
 * The mass storage interface is always enumerated, so the host always sees a
 * removable drive. Outside @ref MscState::Serving it answers TEST UNIT READY
 * with "medium not present", which is exactly what a card reader with an empty
 * slot does, and every host already knows what to do about it. Pressing USB
 * DRIVE is the software equivalent of pushing a card into the slot.
 *
 * The rules below are pure functions for the same reason edtAutoAction() is:
 * this file's other half pulls in TinyUSB and cannot be linked into the host
 * suite, and a rule no test can reach is a rule that will be wrong.
