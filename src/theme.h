/**
 * @file theme.h
 * @brief Runtime colour palette and stroke weight.
 *
 * The UI used to name colours as compile-time constants. It cannot any more:
 * a bench moves between a garage and direct sunlight, and the dark palette
 * that reads beautifully indoors is close to unreadable outdoors on a
 * transmissive IPS panel.
 *
 * So the `C_*` names still exist and every call site is unchanged, but they now
 * index a table that can be swapped at runtime. @ref themeSet() picks which.
 *
 * @section theme_semantics Naming the roles, not the colours
 *
 * Inverting a palette breaks any pairing that was written as a literal. Three
 * names exist purely to keep fill/foreground pairs correct in both themes, and
 * they are the ones to reach for when adding UI:
 *
 * | Name | Means | Dark | High contrast |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `C_INK` | Strongest mark against `C_BG` | white | black |
 * | `C_PAPER` | Same as `C_BG`; text drawn *on* a bright fill | black | white |
 * | `C_ONACCENT` | Text drawn on a saturated fill (red, green, blue) | white | white |
 *
 * `C_PAPER` is what a button's label uses when the button's fill is `C_INK` or
 * `C_AMBER`, because those are the two fills that are bright in one theme and
 * dark in the other — and `C_PAPER` flips with them.
 *
 * The accent colours carry one role each on every screen, named in
 * ui_widgets.h as `UI_COL_*` (docs/design/menu-b.md, decision 11).
 *
 * @see gfx.h, which includes this and re-exports the names.
