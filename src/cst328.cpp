 * @brief CST328 register access and edge detection (RP2350-Touch-LCD-2.8).
 *
 * Registers are **16 bits wide**, the address is 0x1A, mode changes are
 * address-only writes with no data byte, and coordinates are packed 12-bit.
 *
 * The chip reports five contacts. Only the first is read: the UI is
 * single-touch throughout, so the other four would be I2C traffic and dead
 * code. Reading one finger is a 5-byte transfer instead of 27.
 *
 * @see touch.h for the interface this driver implements.
