 * @file usb_dev.h
 * @brief The USB device: a serial port and a card reader on one cable.
 *
 * @section usbdev_why Why this file exists at all
 *
 * The board used to get USB serial for free from `pico_enable_stdio_usb(1)`.
 * That is not a library you add things to — it owns the USB descriptors and
 * runs its own polling loop, and the SDK says so: pico_stdio_usb requires that
 * the user not be using TinyUSB directly. Adding a mass storage interface means
 * taking the descriptors over, and taking the descriptors over means providing
 * the serial port ourselves.
 *
 * So this file is the price of the USB drive feature, and it is worth naming
 * plainly: about a hundred lines of descriptor tables and a forty-line stdio
 * driver, replacing one line of CMake. In exchange the device is ours, and a
 * second interface costs a descriptor entry rather than a rewrite.
 *
 * @section usbdev_layout What the host sees
 *
 * One composite device, two functions:
 *
 * - **CDC ACM** on interfaces 0 and 1 — the serial port, exactly as before, so
 *   `SD_DEBUG` output still arrives and picocom still works.
 * - **MSC** on interface 2 — a removable drive that reports *no medium* until
 *   the user asks for it. @see usb_msc.h
 *
 * The IAD descriptor in front of the CDC pair is what stops Windows treating a
 * composite device as one broken function; without it the serial port
 * enumerates and the drive does not, or the other way round depending on the
 * host's mood.
