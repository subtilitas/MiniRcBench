/**
 * @file settings_flash.cpp
 * @brief The one flash sector the settings live in. Device only.
 *
 * Split from settings.cpp so the rules in that file can be host-tested; see
 * @ref settings_storage. Nothing here has any logic worth testing — it is the
 * RP2350 erase-and-program sequence and the two guards that stop it landing
 * somewhere it should not.
 *
 * @section settings_flash_where Where the sector is
 *
 * The last sector of the address space the build declares, which is
 * `PICO_FLASH_SIZE_BYTES` — 4 MB under `PICO_BOARD=pico2`, whatever a custom
 * board header says otherwise. Deliberately not the last sector of the
 * *physical* part: a settings area whose address depends on which flash chip
 * was fitted is one that moves when Waveshare changes a supplier.
 *
 * @section settings_flash_safety The two guards
 *
 * - **The firmware must not have grown into it.** `__flash_binary_end` is the
 *   end of the image, published by the SDK linker script. If it ever reaches
 *   the sector, saving is refused rather than overwriting code. That is a
 *   runtime check because there is no link-time one: the image and this address
 *   are decided by different parts of the build.
 * - **Core1 must be parked.** `flash_range_erase()` disables XIP, so any core
 *   executing from flash while it runs fetches from a bus that is not
 *   answering. Core1 runs the DShot pump straight out of flash, so it has to be
 *   held in `multicore_lockout` for the duration — which is also why saving is
 *   only ever offered while disarmed.
