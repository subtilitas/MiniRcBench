/**
 * @file board.h
 * @brief Which piece of hardware this firmware is built for.
 *
 * MiniRcBench targets two Waveshare RP2350 boards. They are not variants of
 * one design — the panel hangs off a different SPI instance, the touch
 * controller is a different chip with a different register width, and the I2C
 * bus is a different peripheral. None of that can be probed safely at runtime
 * (probing an I2C bus means first knowing which pins it is on), so the choice
 * is a compile-time constant.
 *
 * Two ways to set it:
 *
 * - Edit the `#define BOARD` line below. This is the only option the Arduino
 *   IDE gives you, since it has no way to pass `-D` flags, and it is what
 *   `test/select_board.sh` rewrites for CI.
 * - Define `BOARD` on the compiler command line. `test/Makefile` and PlatformIO
 *   do this; the `#ifndef` below gets out of the way when they do.
 *
 * @ref board_pins.h turns the choice into an actual pin map.

/**
 * @warning **RP2350-E9.** A pad configured as an input with the internal
 *          pull-down engaged can latch at roughly 2.1 V instead of being pulled
 *          to ground, and reads high from then on. Do not use internal
 *          pull-downs for level detection anywhere in this firmware — drive the
 *          pad and read it back instead. A diagnostic in tools/sdtest did use
 *          one, and duly reported six perfectly good SDIO lines as "held high".
