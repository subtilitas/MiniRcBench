/**
 * @page architecture Architecture
 *
 * README.md is the front page (`USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE`), so this is a
 * \@page rather than a second \@mainpage — Doxygen treats two main pages as a
 * conflict and silently drops one. Note the backslashes: naming those commands
 * unescaped in prose makes Doxygen execute them instead of printing them,
 * which is itself how this block first went wrong.
 *
 * A self-contained bidirectional DShot ESC tester for the Waveshare
 * RP2350-Touch-LCD-2.8. Drag the on-screen throttle and the board sends
 * bidirectional DShot to a single ESC while decoding the eRPM and Extended
 * DShot Telemetry that comes back on the same wire.
 *
 * The image is built for that one board. It does not identify the board it
 * runs on: from the first instruction of setup() it drives the 2.8" pin map,
 * starting with the power latch on GP26. See board_desc.h.
 *
 * @section arch Two cores
 *
 * Bidirectional DShot is half-duplex: the ESC only answers a frame that *you*
 * sent, and it disarms if frames stop arriving. So a telemetry display cannot
 * be a passive sniffer — it has to be the throttle source.
 *
 * Frame timing is the whole game, and the display does multi-millisecond SPI
 * DMA bursts that would wreck it if the two shared a core:
 *
 * | | core0 | core1 |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | Job | touch, rendering, battery sense | DShot frame pump, telemetry decode |
 * | Rate | ~40 Hz | 1 kHz (@ref DSHOT_PERIOD_US) |
 * | Allowed to block | yes, freely | never |
 *
 * The two share one small critical-section-guarded struct. See @ref esc_task.h.
 *
 * @section modules Modules
 *
 * All of these live in `src/`:
 *
 * - @ref config.h — every tunable setting
 * - @ref board_pins.h — the board's pin map, from the schematic
 * - @ref esc_task.h — core1 DShot pump and EDT decode
 * - @ref pin_claim.h — a screen takes the two signal pins from DShot
 * - @ref core1_job.h — core1 work on the claimed pins
 * - @ref ui.h — screens, touch handling, arm and throttle state machines
 * - @ref gfx.h — RGB565 framebuffer, dirty bands, fonts
 * - @ref st7789.h — panel init and DMA blitter
 * - @ref touch.h — capacitive touch, CST328
 * - @ref sd_log.h — blackbox logging to the microSD slot (core0)
 *
 * @warning This drives a real motor. Read the safety section of README.md
 *          before connecting anything with a propeller on it.

 * channel; starting them concurrently makes which one wins a matter of timing.

 * it very nearly does: the first loop() calls uiTick(), which calls
 * escSnapshot(), which takes a critical section. So that critical section is
 * initialised by escTaskInit() on core0 inside setup(), not by escTaskBegin()
 * on core1. Getting this wrong does not race intermittently — core0 wins every
