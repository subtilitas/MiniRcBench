/**
 * @file pio_uart_rx.h
 * @brief A receive-only UART on a PIO state machine, so the telemetry wire can
 *        land on any GPIO.
 *
 * The RP2350's two hardware UARTs can only receive on GPIOs where `n % 4 == 1`
 * — eight pins out of thirty, and which of the two instances each belongs to
 * alternates in pairs of groups. That was fine while the KISS pin was a
 * compile-time constant on a board with pins to spare, and useless on the 2.8":
 * its free-GPIO mask is GP28 and GP29, only GP29 can receive, and GP29 is where
 * the ESC signal wire goes. Enabling KISS there found no pin at all and
 * validation switched it straight back off, which is exactly as helpful as it
 * sounds.
 *
 * A state machine samples whichever pin it is told to. So the rule "the KISS
 * pin must be a UART RX pin" is gone, along with the function that enforced it,
 * and any free GPIO that is not the ESC pin will do.
 *
 * @section pio_uart_rx_cost What it costs
 *
 * One state machine and nine instruction slots, claimed from whichever PIO
 * block has room — never a fixed block, because bidirectional DShot is always
 * resident and the 2.8" also carries the SDIO card driver.
 *
 * The FIFO is the one real difference from the hardware UART: eight bytes with
 * the TX half joined on, against the PL011's thirty-two. At 115200 baud that is
 * about 700 us of slack, so the receiver is drained on every pass of core1's
 * loop rather than once per DShot frame. @see escTaskPoll()
