/*
 * DShot out, and the reply back on the same wire.
 *
 * Implements the DShot protocol of ESCs.  DShot is the name of a protocol; it
 * is used here only to say which ESCs this module works with.  The project
 * claims no right in the name.
 *
 * Plain DShot is one state machine holding the line low between frames.
 * Bidirectional DShot is two: a transmitter that releases the line when the
 * frame ends and raises a flag, and a receiver that starts on that flag and
 * samples the reply.  The turnaround is about 30 us after a frame that is
 * itself 27 us long, so it happens in the PIO (programmable input/output)
 * block and not in a loop on the processor.
 *
 * A frame is sent when the caller asks.  Nothing here has a rate of its own:
 * how often an ESC (electronic speed controller) is told what to do is a
 * property of the project, not of the protocol, and it is the caller's with
 * everything else that is timed against the loop.
 *
 * Extended telemetry is asked for by the caller, not here: this file has no
 * frame rate of its own and a command has to be repeated on one.  The caller
 * sends DSHOT_CMD_EDT_ENABLE on the schedule dshot_edt_frame() sets and
 * passes edt to out_dshot_poll(), which is the only thing that tells an
 * extended frame from an electrical period.
 *
 * From rcbench (https://github.com/subtilitas/rcbench), file
 * protocols/dshot/rp2350/out_dshot.h at commit 453cf334.  The one change is
 * that out_dshot_poll() returns a dshot_reply_t instead of a bool, so a
 * caller can count a missing reply and a damaged one apart.

 * type nibble at zero, which reads as a period too.  With @p edt true, an
 * eRPM frame that is not normalised, an exponent above 0 with bit 8 clear,
 * reads as an extended type.  MiniRcBench's frame pump passes true for every
 * reply (ESC_EDT_DECODE in esc_task.h).
