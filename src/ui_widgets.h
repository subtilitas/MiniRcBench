/**
 * @file ui_widgets.h
 * @brief One button, one header, one row. Every screen draws through these.
 *
 * This file exists because four screens had grown four answers to the same
 * questions, and the differences were not decisions — nobody chose a 6 px
 * corner radius for the main screen and a 5 px one for AM32, or a 26 px header
 * on SETTINGS, a 30 px one on SETUP and a 50 px one on AM32. They were three
 * copies of the same twelve-line function drifting apart one edit at a time,
 * and the most visible symptom was BACK: top-right on two screens, a thin strip
 * along the bottom on two others, and nowhere at all on the main one.
 *
 * The rules the copies now share, and why each is the way it is:
 *
 * - **BACK is always the same rectangle in the header, top right.** Its
 *   position is a habit, and a habit that is wrong half the time is worse than
 *   no habit. @see UI_BACK_X
 * - **A pressed button is drawn additively** — a brighter frame and the label
 *   nudged — never a swapped fill. Buttons here pick a label colour to suit
 *   their own fill (white on red, cyan on panel, background on a flash), so a
 *   pressed state that replaced the fill would have to know about all of them
 *   to stay legible. Adding to what is there cannot break any pairing.
 * - **Touch targets have a floor.** @ref UI_TAP_MIN is what a fingertip needs;
 *   the 18 px BACK strips this replaces were below it.
 * - **A control that is drawn unavailable does not act.** Pass `enabled=false`
 *   to uiButton() and gate its hit test on the same expression. Before this
 *   there were three answers on three screens: SETUP's KISS PIN steppers looked
 *   live and silently moved a pin that was not in use, the logging screen's
 *   START looked dead and started a log anyway, and AM32's REVERT looked dead
 *   and ran. A greyed control that still fires is worse than either, because
 *   the screen has told you it will not.
 *
 * Hit testing is not duplicated here: it is inputPressing() and inputTapped()
 * in ui_input.h, and the wrappers below only spare callers from spelling out
 * four members of a rectangle they already have.
 *
 * @see ui_input.h for the tap, press and repeat rules these are drawn from.
