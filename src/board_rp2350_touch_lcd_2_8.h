 * An RP2350A, a 240x320 ST7789T3 panel, a CST328 touch controller, an IMU, an
 * RTC, an audio codec, a microSD slot wired for SDIO and a 200k/100k battery
 * divider. The GPIO allocation:

 *
 * There are no 2.54 mm headers on this board. Everything is brought out on
 * JST-SH 1.0 mm connectors, so an ESC lead needs a pigtail either way:
 *
 *     J4 (12P): 1=GND  2=VBUS 3=USB_N 4=USB_P 5=GND   6=3V3
 *               7=GP7* 8=GP6* 9=GP0   10=GP1  11=GP28 12=GP29
 *     J3  (4P): 1=GP7* 2=GP6* 3=3V3   4=GND
 *     J5  (4P): 1=GP1  2=GP0  3=3V3   4=GND
 *                                     (* = on the shared I2C bus, do not reuse)
 *
 * @note TP_RST is its own net, separate from LCD_RST. The touch driver
 *       pulses it itself.
