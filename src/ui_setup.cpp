/**
 * @file ui_setup.cpp
 * @brief SETUP screen: wiring, display, and the hold-to-save that persists it.
 *
 * Six rows and two buttons. The interesting parts are not the widgets:
 *
 * - **Only legal values can be selected.** The `-`/`+` buttons step through the
 *   board's free-GPIO mask and past whichever pin the other wire is on, so
 *   there is no invalid pin to reject and no error state to design.
 *   @see stepPinAvoiding()
 * - **LINK is on this screen.** Changing the ESC pin is otherwise unverifiable
 *   without walking back to the main screen, and "the ESC is silent" is exactly
 *   the failure this screen exists to fix.
 * - **Changes apply live; only persistence needs the hold.** Turn the bitrate
 *   down and the pump rebuilds this frame. The one-second hold is about writing
 *   flash, which parks core1, not about the value being dangerous.
 * - **The board is not one of them.** The image is built for the
 *   RP2350-Touch-LCD-2.8, and the first row names it, read-only.
 *
 * Input follows the three rules in ui_input.h: taps fire on release (so a
 * mis-tap can slide off), a pressed control looks pressed, and the `-`/`+`
 * steppers repeat while held. SAVE stays a deliberate one-second hold and
 * only counts a hold that *began* on the button.
