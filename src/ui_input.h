/**
 * @file ui_input.h
 * @brief Touch idioms shared by every screen: taps, held repeats, pressed state.
 *
 * Three rules live here rather than in each screen, because they were
 * inconsistent between them and the inconsistency was the bug:
 *
 * - **A tap fires on release, not on touch-down.** A capacitive panel has no
 *   travel, so a press that commits immediately gives you no way to notice a
 *   mis-tap and slide off. Every screen except the ARM button used to commit on
 *   touch-down.
 * - **A button under a finger has to look like it.** Only BEEP ever changed
 *   appearance when touched, out of about twenty controls. On glass, a control
 *   that does not react reads as one that did not register.
 * - **A stepper repeats while held, and accelerates.** The AM32 editor did
 *   this and the settings screen did not, so raising the throttle ceiling from
 *   20 % to 100 % was eight separate taps.
 *
 * @see TouchState, which supplies the press position these rules test against.
