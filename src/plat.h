/**
 * @file plat.h
 * @brief The handful of Arduino conveniences this firmware still wants.
 *
 * The rest of the codebase talks to the Pico SDK directly — `gpio_put()`,
 * `spi_write_blocking()`, `pio_sm_*`, `critical_section_*`. What it also used
 * was `millis()`, `micros()` and `delay()`, in about sixty places, and those
 * are the only reason `Arduino.h` was ever included in most files.
 *
 * The names are kept deliberately. Renaming them to `platMillis()` would have
 * touched sixty lines across nine files for no behavioural gain, and every one
 * of those lines is a chance to introduce a bug in code that currently works.
 * These are ordinary SDK calls wearing familiar names, not a compatibility
 * layer with anything behind it.
 *
 * @note `millis()` wraps every 49.7 days and `micros()` every 71.6 minutes.
 *       Both are used only in `now - then` comparisons, which stay correct
 *       across a wrap provided the arithmetic is unsigned — the same property
 *       the Arduino versions had, and the same trap if a difference is ever
 *       assigned to a signed type before comparing.
