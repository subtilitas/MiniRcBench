/**
 * @file settings.h
 * @brief Settings the user can change on the board, persisted to flash.
 *
 * Everything here used to be a `#define` in @ref config.h, changeable only by
 * recompiling. Those values are still there and are still the defaults — what
 * changed is that they are now the *starting point* rather than the answer.
 *
 * @section settings_why Why these, and not the rest of config.h
 *
 * A setting earns a place here if getting it wrong is quiet. The ESC pin is the
 * canonical case: point it at a GPIO no wire is on and nothing errors, nothing
 * warns, and the ESC simply never hears a frame. That is not a value to require
 * a toolchain to change.
 *
 * Timings, buffer sizes and protocol constants stay in config.h. They fail
 * loudly, they are not things a user on a bench needs mid-session, and every
 * one of them added here is another field that has to survive a version bump.
 *
 * @section settings_storage Storage
 *
 * One dedicated flash sector, at the top of the address space the build
 * declares — see settings_flash.cpp. The block is versioned and CRC'd, and
 * anything that fails to validate falls back to compiled defaults *whole*,
 * never field by field. @see settingsValidate()
 *
 * Writing is deliberately manual. A flash erase parks core1 for tens of
 * milliseconds, which stops the DShot pump; that is a thing to do on purpose
 * with a button, not a side effect of turning a dial.
