"""Documentation checks for MiniRcBench.

Enforces what actually goes wrong, and nothing else:

  1. every function declared in a header carries a doc comment
  2. every @param names a parameter that exists in the signature it precedes
  3. @param coverage is all-or-nothing -- Doxygen warns on partial coverage
     regardless of WARN_NO_PARAMDOC, so documenting one argument out of six
     is worse than documenting none
  4. every @ref points at something that exists
  5. Doxygen commands are escaped when merely being talked about; writing
     "@mainpage" in prose makes Doxygen execute it, which silently produces a
     second main page
  6. backticks inside a doc comment are balanced, otherwise Doxygen hits the
     end of the block still waiting to close a code span
  7. a @ref is not immediately followed by a colon -- Doxygen's reference
     grammar includes ':' so that Class::member resolves, so "@ref foo.h: and
     then some prose" is read as a reference to "foo.h:" and does not
  8. every relative link in the running record (STATUS.md, CHANGELOG.md) and
     the design notes (docs/design/*.md) names a file that exists, and an
     anchor into a Markdown file names a heading that exists

Deliberately narrower than Doxygen's WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED, which also fires on
file-static internals. A comment on `s_scroll` saying "scroll position" is
noise; a public function with no documentation, or an @param that silently
stopped matching after a rename, is not.

Exit status is the number of problems, capped at 255: a process exit status
holds 8 bits, so an uncapped count of 256 would read as success. CI fails on
any non-zero status without extra plumbing.

Paths are resolved from the repository root, found from this file's own
location, so the result does not depend on the directory the script is run
from.
