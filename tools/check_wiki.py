"""Structural checks for the wiki in wiki/.

A GitHub wiki has no build step, so nothing tells you a link is broken until a
reader clicks it. These are the four ways this particular wiki can break, and
nothing else:

  1. a link points at a page that does not exist -- usually a rename, since page
     names come from filenames and a rename is silent;
  2. a link points at an anchor no heading produces;
  3. an image is referenced that the test suite does not capture, which is what
     happens when a screenshot is dropped or renamed upstream;
  4. the two languages drift apart -- a page added in one and not the other, or
     a page missing the switcher that gets you to its counterpart.

Run it after `python3 tools/make_previews.py --wiki`, or the image check has
nothing to check against. Exit status is the number of problems, so CI fails
without extra plumbing.
