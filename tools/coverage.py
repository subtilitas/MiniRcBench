"""Report host-suite line coverage of src/, and keep the published figures.

`make -C test coverage` builds an instrumented copy of the host suite in
test/cov/ and runs it. This script reads the counters through gcov (the GNU
coverage tool, part of GCC) and renders two blocks:

  - one sentence in README.md, between the coverage:start and coverage:end
    markers;
  - a table per file in STATUS.md, between the coverage-table:start and
    coverage-table:end markers. STATUS.md and its markers are optional; when
    either is missing, the table goes to stdout instead.

    python3 tools/coverage.py            # write both blocks
    python3 tools/coverage.py --check    # fail on drift or below a floor
    python3 tools/coverage.py --print    # print both blocks, write nothing

`--check` is what CI (continuous integration) runs. It exits 1 when a block
differs from what this script would write, or when coverage is below
MIN_TOTAL or any file is below MIN_FILE.

What counts: every file under src/ that gcov reports a line for. That is each
.cpp in the Makefile's SRCS, the C files of the DShot core in src/dshot/ and
of the SD card protocol layers in src/sdio/ (in the Makefile's CSRCS),
ui_am32.cpp (test_ui.cpp includes it), and the headers whose inline functions
the suite calls. The rcbench files in lib/rcbench/ are in CSRCS and are
instrumented too, but they lie outside src/ and do not count. A line counts
as covered when any translation unit executes it. An inline function no test
calls is not emitted, so it has no lines and does not count. A source in SRCS
with no executable line has to be in DATA_ONLY, and a DATA_ONLY file that
gains one fails the run.

Needs only Python 3 and the gcov that matches the compiler. Line counts
depend on the GCC version, so CI pins its runner image.
