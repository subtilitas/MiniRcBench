/**
 * @file main.c
 * @brief Minimal standalone SD bring-up test. Nothing but the card.
 *
 * The point is to bisect a card that will not initialise: this firmware shares
 * only sd_hw_config.c with MiniRcBench, and starts no display, no touch, no
 * PIO, no second core. If the card mounts here but not in the firmware, the
 * fault is in the integration; if it fails here too, the integration is
 * exonerated and the problem is the board, the slot or the card.
 *
 * It also sweeps the SDIO clock downwards. Some cards -- SanDisk in particular
 * are reputed to be fussy at init -- will not enumerate at a speed they will
 * run at afterwards, and that is invisible when only one speed is ever tried.
 *
 * Built for the RP2350-Touch-LCD-2.8 only, like the firmware. Output goes to
 * USB serial at 115200 baud.

/**
 * @brief Pin integrity test, without ever engaging an internal pull-down.
 *
 * The obvious test -- pull each way and see if the pin follows -- is wrong on
 * RP2350. Erratum **E9** says a pad configured as an input with the internal
 * pull-down engaged can latch at roughly 2.1 V instead of being pulled to
 * ground, and once latched it reads high no matter what is done to it
 * afterwards. An earlier version of this function did exactly that and reported
 * all six SDIO lines as "held high", which is not a fault any board has; it was
 * the erratum, triggered by the test itself.
 *
 * So this drives the pad instead, which is unambiguous and unaffected:
 *
 *   drive high, read back 0  ->  shorted to ground
 *   drive low,  read back 1  ->  shorted to 3V3
 *   both agree               ->  the pin can be driven, which is all SD needs
 *
 * The pull-up read is kept because it is safe -- E9 concerns the pull-down --
 * and because it distinguishes a floating line from one a card is holding.
 * Every pin is left driven low afterwards rather than floating, so nothing is
 * parked at an intermediate voltage where E9 could bite later.
 *
 * @return true if every pin can be driven both ways.
