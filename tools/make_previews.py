"""Assemble the documentation screenshots from the host suite's output.

    cd test && make          # writes shot_*.ppm
    python3 tools/make_previews.py

The README says the screens "are rendered by the host test suite from the real
UI code, so they cannot drift away from what the board shows". That was only
half true for a while: the frames came from the tests, but stitching them into
docs/*.png was a manual step nobody repeated, so the published images went stale
across several UI changes while the claim stayed put. This script is the missing
half -- one command, run after the tests, and the claim holds again.

Deliberately dependency-free. Pillow would be three lines shorter and one more
thing to install before you can update a picture, which is how the manual step
survived as long as it did.
